# Catch The Turtle Game

This is a simple "Catch the Turtle" game built using Python's `turtle` module. The objective of the game is to click on the turtles that appear on the screen to score points before the timer runs out. The game randomly shows a turtle at various positions on the grid, and players need to click on it to earn points.

## How the Game Works

1. **Score**: Each time you click on a turtle, your score increases by 1. The score is displayed at the top of the screen.
2. **Timer**: The game runs for 10 seconds. The timer counts down from 10 and is displayed on the screen. When the timer reaches 0, the game ends and shows "Game Over".
3. **Random Turtles**: Turtles appear randomly on a predefined grid. You must click on them before they disappear.

## Controls

- Click on the turtles to score points.
- The game will automatically stop when the time is up.
